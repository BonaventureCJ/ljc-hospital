# ljc-hospital
This is a fully responsive website in development for a hypothetical hospital. It was built with React JavaScript, CSS, JSX(XML), Bootstrap, React router, React icons, and a little bit of HTML. Feel Free to explore the sites starting from the 'Home' button.

# Introduction
The is a website in development for a hypothetical LJC Hospital.

# Composition
The site was built with React (the most popular frontend technology for building powerful modern web applications), JavaScript, CSS, JSX(XML), Bootstrap, React router, React icons, and a little bit of HTML; and hosted on GitHub (Note: I am still having challenges correctly deploying this webapp on github pages).

# Placeholder text
Most of the texts inside are Lorem placeholder(dummy) text, written in pseudo-Latin. Content and SEO writers replace these with more relevant text. The external links have not yet been assigned and so will not work.

# Placeholder Images
Image credits to www.unsplash.com. Most images used are from www.unsplash.com; therefore, I do NOT claim ownership or any rights to any of these images.  All images and the corresponding copyrights belong to their respective copyright owners. Any infringement is not intentional as the site indicates the images are free to use.

# Web App Support
The site is a dynamic site which is unfortunately hosted in my personal GitHub account (GitHub fully supports only static websites). This means that some of the functionality of the website may be lost or the site may be found to be behaving 'funny'.  One of such strange outcomes is getting a 404 error if the page is refreshed. Other functionalities and appearance may be affected too. The search bar is not yet working.

# Navigation and use
To better appreciate the website, once you visit it, click on the 'Home' tab at the navigation bar, scroll down through it and assess it critically. Then click on 'Services' tab, scroll down and do the same, then on 'About' tab, and finally on 'Contact' tab. If you refresh the page, you may have to start afresh because of the 404 error.

# Testing
Assess everything about the site; check the colour themes, check the carousel. It should be cycling 3 pictures by itself or on Click. Check that the accordion is working fine too-it was used the build the FAQs section. Check if you like the picture cards, check that the images and site display well.
Very importantly, check that the site is mobile responsive - it should appear well on different screen sizes such as medium screen devices (eg laptops or desktop computers) and also on handheld devices (like phones and tablets).

# Site improvement
If you notice any error(s) please report it to me indicating the browser you are using and whether it's a phone or PC. You might want to check with both phone and PC to appreciate the power of mobile responsive websites. 
If you feel I didn't get any parts of it right, point it out so I can learn and improve on future projects!
